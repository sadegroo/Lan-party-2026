# Shrek's Rules for LAN Parties 2026 - AI RAMageddon Edition

Shrek's swamp is now powered by onion-layered neural nets, but those greedy AI data centers are hogging all the RAM like Donkey at a carrot buffet.[1][2] Corona's out, but if you show up with a virus in your code or outdated drivers, Shrek will feed you to the swamp AI—complete with hallucinations and infinite loops.[3] Disobedience means punishments like Ogre-roared kernel panics, intimidating VR roars, or a dose of "Swampware" malware.[3]

## Definitions
Shrek is a large, green, physically intimidating ogre with a Scottish accent and a new side gig training LLMs on swamp folklore.[3] He hosts LAN parties and despises waiting for updates while his GPUs overheat from RAM shortage.[1] His OCD rules now include AI multipliers for extra pain.[3]

- **Non-Updated Game (NUG)**: Any game needing a download, now including AI "fine-tunes" that balloon to 50GB because of context window bloat.[4][3]
- **One Unit of Alcohol (ua)**: 10ml (8g) pure alcohol; a 250ml 5% beer = 1.25 ua. AI-era twist: "hallucinated" units don't count if Shrek's model glitches.[3]
- **Reference Alcoholic Punishment Elixir (RAPE)**: Calculated booze penalty, now juiced by AI demand factors.[3]
- **Final Units Consumable (FUC)**: Your actual chug amount after Shrek's Multiplier (SM).[3]
- **Shrek's Multiplier (SM)**: Starts at 1, ramps up like HBM prices from AI greed.[5]
- **New: RAM Deficit Penalty (RDP)**: Extra for bringing rigs with under 64GB RAM in this "RAMageddon"—AI servers stole your sticks![6]

## Rules
1. Only NUGs from Appendix A get punished; GPU drivers and AI model updates (like those VRAM-hungry agentic AIs) count as NUGs too.[3][7]
2. Spot a NUG? Yell for Shrek immediately, or he'll detect it with his new swamp-cam neural net.[3]
3. RAPE = $$\sqrt{\text{SIZE}}$$, where SIZE is update in GB. For AI bloat, add 0.5 if it's "high-bandwidth" nonsense.[3]
4. Unknown size? Assume 1/10th game size, including "on-device AI" updates that aren't.[8]
5. Uninstalled game? SIZE = 1/2 total—F2P or not, pay up like Micron stock![9]
6. No purchase? Shrek mocks your engineer salary not covering games *or* 2x RAM prices.[3][10]
7. Buy at party? Full SIZE penalty + peer pressure roar from Shrek's TTS voice.[3]
8. SM boosts if:
   - Hiding NUG: +1 (Shrek's anomaly detection spots you).[4]
   - Repeat offender: +0.25 per prior NUG.
   - No "Sorry Shrek" in 60s: +0.5 (voice recog fails = extra).[3]
   - **2026 AI Special**: Rig <64GB RAM? +1 RDP because "AI boom ate the DRAM supply, ye fool!"[11][12]
9. FUC = RAPE × SM. Chug within 15min or face Shrek's "evolutionary algorithm" torture (endless retries).[3][8]
10. One punishment per NUG per PC—multi-boxers get no mercy.[3]
11. Buyout? FUC × 5 in EUR to Shrek's swamp crypto wallet (ETH fees apply, thanks AI miners).[3]
12. **Bonus Rule**: Bring <128GB total LAN RAM? Group RDP—Shrek force-installs "efficient AI" that still VRAM-starves everyone.[13]
